                                   VIRTUAL INVIGILATOR FOR ONLINE ASSESSMENT
In this project, we have designed a remote proctoring model using Python language and various modules. A software-only solution for conducting fair and credible online examination. We have built an (semi) Automated detection model that can be used to curb malpractices, cheatings, etc during online examination. In it we have demonstrated how digital form invigilation can be implemented using audio, video and various anti-cheating techniques. We have tried to create a visual and sound cohesive environment to detect the examinee indulging in unfair means.
